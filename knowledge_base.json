    {
      "question": "What is Java?",
      "answer": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the features of Java?",
      "answer": "Java has several features that make it powerful and popular:\n- Simple\n- Object-Oriented\n- Portable\n- Platform Independent\n- Secured\n- Robust\n- Architecture Neutral\n- Interpreted\n- High Performance\n- Multithreaded\n- Distributed\n- Dynamic"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?",
      "answer": "The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. The JVM has three notions: specification, implementation, and instance. It provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is bytecode in Java?",
      "answer": "Bytecode in Java is the intermediate representation of Java code that is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is a platform-independent code that can be executed on any system that has a JVM."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a class in Java?",
      "answer": "A class in Java is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields (variables) and methods to define the behaviors of an object."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an object in Java?",
      "answer": "An object is an instance of a class. It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. An object has a state (fields) and behavior (methods)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is inheritance in Java?",
      "answer": "Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class. It is used for code reuse and method overriding. The class which inherits the properties of another is called a subclass, and the class whose properties are inherited is called a superclass."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is polymorphism in Java?",
      "answer": "Polymorphism in Java is the ability of a single action to operate in different ways. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The two types of polymorphism in Java are compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is encapsulation in Java?",
      "answer": "Encapsulation in Java is the technique of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is abstraction in Java?",
      "answer": "Abstraction in Java is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It is used to reduce programming complexity and effort. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to implement abstraction in Java."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are interfaces in Java?",
      "answer": "Interfaces in Java are abstract types that are used to specify the behavior that classes must implement. An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in Java?",
      "answer": "The main differences between abstract classes and interfaces in Java are:\n- Abstract classes can have method implementations, while interfaces cannot (prior to Java 8).\n- A class can inherit only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.\n- Abstract classes can have constructors, but interfaces cannot.\n- Abstract classes can have fields, while fields in interfaces are implicitly public, static, and final."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is exception handling in Java?",
      "answer": "Exception handling in Java is a powerful mechanism that handles runtime errors, allowing the normal flow of the program to be maintained. It uses five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?",
      "answer": "Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. These must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword. Unchecked exceptions are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They are subclasses of RuntimeException and usually represent programming errors, such as logic mistakes or improper use of an API."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Java package?",
      "answer": "A package in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Packages are used to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, and to make searching and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations easier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between '=='' and 'equals()' in Java?",
      "answer": "In Java, '==' is a reference comparison operator that checks if two references point to the same object in memory. The 'equals()' method is used for content comparison, meaning it checks if two objects are meaningfully equivalent based on their state."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Java Collections Framework?",
      "answer": "The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures. It includes interfaces like List, Set, and Map, and classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a constructor in Java?",
      "answer": "A constructor in Java is a block of code used to initialize an object. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. Constructors are called when an instance of a class is created."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the types of constructors in Java?",
      "answer": "There are two types of constructors in Java:\n- Default constructor: A constructor with no parameters, automatically provided by the compiler if no constructors are defined.\n- Parameterized constructor: A constructor with one or more parameters, defined explicitly by the programmer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Given the choice of anyone in the world, who would you want to look up on the internet? Why?",
      "answer": "If given the choice, I would want to look up Leonardo da Vinci. As a quintessential Renaissance man, his contributions span art, science, engineering, anatomy, and numerous other fields. By examining his work and life, we can gain insights into his multifaceted genius and understand how his curiosity and creativity led to groundbreaking advancements in so many areas. Leonardo's notebooks, filled with sketches and musings, reflect a mind constantly questioning and exploring the world, making him a fascinating subject of study for anyone interested in the intersection of art and science."
